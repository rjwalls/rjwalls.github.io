## Robert J. Walls

![Robert J. Walls]({{ site.base }}/img/walls-sm.jpg)

I am a postdoctoral scholar in Department of Computer Science at The
Pennsylvania State University working with [Prof. Patrick
McDaniel](http://www.patrickmcdaniel.org/).  My research is focused on
developing the science of security.

Previously, I attended the School of Computer Science at the [University of
Massachusetts](http://www.cs.umass.edu/) advised by [Prof. Brian
Levine](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~brian/). My research there focused on
advancing digital forensics by providing law enforcement with novel techniques
for investigating crimes. My past work includes an inference-based approach for
mobile phone triage and an in-depth analysis of contraband on peer-to-peer
networks. You can find my view on the difference between forensics and security
[here](http://forensics.umass.edu/publications.php?q=Walls:2011a).

I studied at [The University of Texas at Arlington](http://www.cse.uta.edu/)
under the direction of [Prof. Matthew Wright](http://isec.uta.edu/mwright/).
While there I focused on network security and was awarded the CSE Outstanding
Masterâ€™s thesis award for my work on the design and detection of covert timing
channels.

While at UMass, I was admitted to Ph.D candidacy with distinction and awarded
the department's Outstanding Synthesis Project award. I am also honored to have
received the 2011 Yahoo Key Scientific Challenges award in the Security &
Privacy category.
