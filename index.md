### About Me

I am a postdoctoral scholar in Department of Electrical Engineering and
Computer Science at The Pennsylvania State University working with [Prof.
Patrick McDaniel](http://www.patrickmcdaniel.org/).  My research is focused on
developing the science of security.

Previously, I attended the School of Computer Science at the [University of
Massachusetts](http://www.cs.umass.edu/) advised by [Prof. Brian
Levine](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~brian/). My research there focused on
advancing digital forensics by providing law enforcement with novel techniques
for investigating crimes. My past work includes an inference-based approach for
mobile phone triage and an in-depth analysis of contraband on peer-to-peer
networks. You can find my view on the difference between forensics and security
[here](http://forensics.umass.edu/publications.php?q=Walls:2011a).

I studied at [The University of Texas at Arlington](http://www.cse.uta.edu/)
under the direction of [Prof. Matthew Wright](http://isec.uta.edu/mwright/).
While there I focused on network security and was awarded the CSE Outstanding
Masterâ€™s thesis award for my work on the design and detection of covert timing
channels.

While at UMass, I was admitted to Ph.D candidacy with distinction and awarded
the department's Outstanding Synthesis Project award. I am also honored to have
received the 2011 Yahoo Key Scientific Challenges award in the Security &
Privacy category.

### Projects

I've had the opportunity to work on a number of interesting research projects
during my career. Here is a summary of some of my efforts. 

#### Phone Forensics

Mobile phones contain evidence that is invaluable for criminal investigations.
However, commercially-available forensic tools must be hand-tailored to each
phone model. If no tools support the target phone, then extracting the phone's
information requires investigators to  examine the stored data byte by byte.
To address this problem,  I've developed general algorithms and techniques for
recovering information from phones even if the exact  storage format is unknown
or the data has been logically deleted. 

*Source Code:* Our prototype, DEC0DE, is available on
[Github](https://github.com/umass-forensics/DEC0DE-forensics).


#### Improving the Process

Like all computer scientists, I am constantly on the lookout for tools or
methods that will help me be more efficient in my work. Here are a few
repositories that you may find helpful.
 - *Latex Paper Template.* Tired of wasting half an hour setting up your paper
directory every time you start a new project? Try my paper template 
instead. Source Code: [Github](https://github.com/rjwalls/paper-template)
 - *Slidify Tutorial.* I am a big fan of presentations, R, and Markdown---Slidify
beautifully combines all three. Check out my simple Slidify tutorial 
[here](http://rjwalls.github.io/SlidifyTest). Source Code: [Github](https://github.com/rjwalls/SlidifyTest)
