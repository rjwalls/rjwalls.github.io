# Dec0de

DEC0DE is a system for recovering information from phones with unknown storage
formats, a critical problem for forensic triage. Because phones have myriad
custom hardware and software, we examine only the stored data. Via flexible
descriptions of typical data structures, and using a classic dynamic
programming algorithm, we are able to identify call logs and address book
entries in phones across varied models and manufacturers.
